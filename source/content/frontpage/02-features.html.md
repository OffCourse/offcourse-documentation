- concept: Curate the Web 
  summery: |
    How many wheels you reinvented already? Our guess would be ‘too many’. Somehow, we keep creating new content, textbooks and courses, but most information is out there already. So gather those interesting blogs posts, podcasts and tutorials and turn them into interesting collections on a topic you love.
- concept: Switch Modes
  summery: | 
    You learn more effectively by switching modes: from learner to teacher and back again. Be both. Changing your perspective makes your learning more active and your retention will surge. Be on the lookout for the best resource for you and make changes in existing collections to share them with others.
- concept: Distribute Versions
  summery: | 
    This one’s a bit technical, but it basically means that when you start working on a collection of existing resources, you make a copy that is now entirely yours. You can make your own additions and changes. If you want to share your changes, you can push them and make them visible for everyone. The content stays on the move and so do you.
- concept: Track Progress
  summery: | 
    Sharing and comparing your progress with others is a proven way to stay motivated. But even if you’re not competitive, it’s still good to know how you measure up against your peers. You can enable Offcourse_ to track what you learn. It will help you reach just a little bit further and at the end, you will have created a personal dashboard you can share with your family or a future employer.
- concept: A Community
  summery: | 
    In school, your teacher decided what you should learn. Here, that’s you! You and your peers gather the most interesting learning resources on the web. Through these lists, you get in touch with people from all over the world who are interested in the same things as you. Imagine the different perspectives, and what you’ll learn from them.
