We have explored a few paths that we could take with Offcourse.

## Current 

Our second iteration is aiming more towards a flatter structure, while maintaining the core idea's.

<div class="markdown__github-container">
  <p>We're open source, so check us out on Github:</p>
  <div class="markdown__github-button">
    <iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=offcourse&repo=offcourse-frontend&type=watch&count=false&size=large&v=2" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="100px" height="30px"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

## Social

The second approach was to let another team take a crack at it. They focussed on the social part of learning.
