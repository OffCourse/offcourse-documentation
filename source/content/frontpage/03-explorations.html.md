We have explored a few paths that we could take with Offcourse.

## Current 

Our second iteration is aiming more towards a flatter structure, while maintaining the core idea's.

<div class="markdown__github-container">
  <p>We're open source, so check us out on Github:</p>
  <div class="markdown__github-button">
    <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/offcourse/offcourse-frontend" data-style="mega" aria-label="Watch offcourse/offcourse-frontend on GitHub">Watch on Github</a>
  </div>
</div>

## Social

The second approach was to let another team take a crack at it. They focussed on the social part of learning.
