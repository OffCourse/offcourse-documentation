<div class="emphasis">There’s an easy way to organize your own learning. One that's simple and fun. One that allows you to learn any skill from anywhere with an internet connection and maps it all.</div>

It’s called Offcourse and we are building it. Offcourse_ will allow you to collect, share and track the best content in one place. Offcourse_ is free, open source, and designed to recommend learning tracks specifically for you.
