<div class="emphasis">There’s an easy way to organize your own learning. One that is simple and fun. One that allows you to learn any skill from anywhere with an internet connection and maps it all.</div>

<div class="container"><div class="emphasis-textbar">It’s called Offcourse_ and we are building it.</div></div>

Offcourse_ will allow you to collect, share and track the best content in one place. Offcourse_ is free, open source, and design to recommend learning tracks specifically for you.
