# There’s an easy way to organize your own learning. One that's simple and fun. One that allows you to learn any skill from anywhere with an internet connection and maps it all.

It’s called Offcourse and we are building it. Offcourse will allow you to collect, share and track the best content in one place. Offcourse is free, open source, and designed to recommend learning tracks specifically for you.
