## Compose your learning

It's hard to structure and organize your own learning, especially when you're new to a topic. Do you have a hard time finding accurate and reliable sources on a topic you know little about? 

Finding good content is difficult. We are building a future of learning that's distributed, free and open source. Offcourse_ is an online learning hub for collecting and sharing learning resources. It makes it simple and fun to start learning something new from anywhere with an internet connection.
