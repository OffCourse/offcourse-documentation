# When you find the right resources at the right time, you can master any skill you want.

Almost anything you may want to learn is posted online every minute of every day. Both experts and learners of nearly every topic imaginable (from coding to soldering), write blogs posts and create videos to share their skills with you. The hard part is knowing where to start and what to do next. Yet, by finding the right resources at the right time, we believe that you can master nearly any skill you want.

Offcourse is an online tool that helps you to collect links to the best learning resources on the web and share them with others. Offcourse allows you to copy and alter other peopleâ€™s lists to make them suit your personal learning goals. Offcourse also features smart learning analytics and learning data analysis, providing valuable insight in how you learn and to recommend you what blog post, article or podcast to read or listen to next. Offcoure makes learning simple.
