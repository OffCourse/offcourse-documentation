There’s an easy way to structure your learning. One that is simple and fun. One that allows you to learn any skill from anywhere with an internet connection and maps it all. It’s called Offcourse_ and we are building it.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Offcourse_ will allow you to structure your learning in an online hub that gives you the tools to collect, share and track all your learning in one place. It’s free, it’s open source, and designed to recommend learning tracks specifically for you. So no more Javascript 101, but specific lists on how to learn Clojure or become a functional programmer.
