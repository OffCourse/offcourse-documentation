With the results of earlier prototypes and the research in mind, the current digital space co-designed by Lifely, is an environment that helps students and teachers to organise, track and share learning resources and exercises. The tool facilitates stealing, making in sharing. On the platform you can:

- Create, curate and alter hand-picked collections of resources on a specific topic and create a personal learning trajectory
- Gather specific feedback on early drafts of your work and the work of your peers
- See what others are doing and have done before you – in your class, in parallel classes and classes of the years before you

The tool isn’t just a tool. It is the development of a teaching practice that makes education accessible, shared and usable again.
