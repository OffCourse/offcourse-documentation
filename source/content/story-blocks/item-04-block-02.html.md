Bringing together early prototypes, classroom experience and research, the environment – codesigned with Lifely – became an online space where the boundary between students and teachers is continually questioned and everybody can organise, track and share their learning efforts through curation. The tool embodies a coding mindset and helps you to steal, make and share over and over again.

On the platform, people can: 

- Create, curate and alter hand-picked collections of resources on a specific topic and create a personal learning trajectory
- Gather specific feedback on early drafts of your work and the work of your peers
- See what others are doing and have done before you – in your class, in parallel classes and classes of the years before you

But the tool isn’t just a tool – it embodies the further development of a teaching practice that leverages the knowledge and information that exists around us. We believe in a future of shared learning – inside and outside of universities – and knowledge institutions are here to further shape this future of learning.
