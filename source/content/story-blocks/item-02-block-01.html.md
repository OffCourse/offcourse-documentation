Imagine two classrooms. In the first, you see a teacher who teaches a group of students. The student’s contribution is only minimal. In the second classroom, you see a group of people sharing what they know with each other. Yet, many traditional classrooms – and even many online learning spaces – are modelled after the first classroom. 

The Coding the Humanities pilot set out to create an alternative classroom where knowledge is contributed and shared by everyone.
