- concept: Curation
  summery: |
    We believe that teaching is the best way of learning. The student/teacher is the main audience for our tool. We want to make his job easy. That list of bookmarks awkwardly put in a student manual, no more. Googling everything? That only works for programmers with very concrete problems. Build your own site? Admirable, but who's updating it? We have chosen to provide you with an interface in which you can curate everything you see, with the flip of a switch.
  feature: Inline editing
- concept: Reuse
  summery: | 
    When writing you own content ain't fast enough, steal! While a centralised model might be desirable for Wikipedia to form a certain consensus, we believe that the distributed model is better for learning. What is true is after all largely subjective, and our tools should correctly represent this.
  feature: Forking
- concept: Structure
  summery: | 
    Learning needs structure. Structure is embedded in content, but never can enough content be collected in a single unit to encompass all learning. We need something that structures these units, and does so in a S.M.A.R.T. way. Learning emerges from the interaction between structure and content.
  feature: Lists
- concept: Exploration
  summery: | 
    What you learn cannot be predefined. We believe in learning in an organic way. But setting you lose in the largest library that the world has known, the internet, is not at all that educative. We provide a suggestive interface to direct your learning just a tad, so that you still have a 'major'.
  feature: Suggestive interface
- concept: Assessment
  summery: | 
    Humans want to control. Teachers often sacrifice learning in favour of measurement, heck, even students favour measurement. We all want to know how attain that golden treasure under the horizon. Preferably with the least amount of effort. Our tools gives in to that insatiable desire for measurability, but with a twist. Instead of prescribing, we describe learning trajectories with a great amount of detail.
  feature: Data
- concept: Showing
  summery: |
    Media are social phenomenon by definition. We don't believe in sharing as a goal in itself. But we aren't at all too font of the crazy nut studying in his attic as well. With our interface you can coherently show multiple pieces of content. You can show which content defines you and you can show an coherent educative unit. But there is no simple "like", or "+1" button.
  feature: Shareable units (..)
- concept: Collaboration
  summery: | 
    Learning becomes so much more fun when done together. We cannot ignore this and therefore we provide functionality for it. But this is not the core of our product. There are much better providers for togetherness and we strive to make use of their tools. Discus, Slack, Facebook/Twitter, Github, all of them can be integrated. 
  feature: Chat

Code is merely a concrete materialization of thought. Your application can never be better that the thought behind it. We continue to discuss our thoughts to enrich our perspective. But we also like actionability and for that reason we have mapped some of our most important thoughts to concrete features. Read on to explore:
