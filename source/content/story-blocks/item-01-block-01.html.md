We are building a future of education that's free and open source. 

The educational system is failing us. Education becomes more and more expensive, but most things to learn can be found online. But it's hard to structure and organize your own learning, especially when you're new to a topic. Our platform will make this as simple as possible for you.

Offcourse_ is an online learning hub that allows you track your development, leave a trail for peers to follow, and to make it easy to share your progress with your family or a future employer. 

Use Offcourse_ to learn wherever you are, whatever you want.

Happy learning!
