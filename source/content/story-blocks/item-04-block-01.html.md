Students use all kinds of different tools to store resources. Teachers use all kinds of different tools to share resources. Only a few of these tools are designed to facilitate learning. In the autumn of 2015, we interviewed nine Coding the Humanities students about the way they study and we could describe the following: 

- Learning is telling a story
- You learn best with a clear and personal goal in mind
- Students share little of what they learn or make
- And they are often unaware of the way they learn

We mapped the students learning habits and set out to create a tool that can support and enrich studentsâ€™ learning processes.
