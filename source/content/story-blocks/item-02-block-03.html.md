In May 2013, Coding the Humanities organised a one-month coding boot camp for humanities students. We created a space where students were encouraged to shape their own learning paths. Students were encouraged adopt a programmerâ€™s mindset, which meant: 

- Be lazy. Steal the work of others
- Be impatient. Make something before you know it 
- Be bold. Boast and share every step take 

Out of everyone and everything, from teachers, to students, to guest lecturers, most knowledge came from Google. Almost anything students needed to know, they found online. It turned out there was no need for information. There was a need to structure, track and share all the things that they found.
