In May 2013, Coding the Humanities created its first alternative classroom to create an environment to involve students in their own teaching practice. Students were encouraged to be: 

- Lazy and use the work of others
- Impatient and make something before you know something
- Bold and share every step they take

Knowledge can come from everywhere, but as it turned out, most knowledge came from Google. Students found everything they needed to know in each other or the internet. There was no need for content. There was a need to organize what they found.
