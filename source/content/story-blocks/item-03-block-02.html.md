From Coding the Humanities emerged the need for a tool that would support this type of content curation for learning. The students developed a paper prototype of a tool that helped them structure series of learning resources in meaningful paths.

The tool leverages people’s knowledge. And better yet, it allows people to focus on a topic that is specific and personal to them. The tool encourages the student to share their collections – to have them teach others and be taught something in return.

Creating a collection is a learning process. Sharing your collection with someone else is teaching. On the platform, students go back and forth: they learn, they teach and repeat. The teacher becomes a facilitator.
