# About

In March 2013, the idea for Coding the Humanities was born in Wassenaar, The Netherlands, during a two-day workshop, organized by NIAS, on public and private initiatives in the Digital Humanities.

Here, Marijn Koolen and Jan Hein Hoogstad, both assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam at the time, formed their first ideas for Coding the Humanities – a program that would teach humanities students how to code their own tools for doing research, learning from and working with various private partners in the technology and cultural industry. 

This pilot turned into a successful set of BA, MA and staff courses, a set of teaching practices and the development of a prototype of a tool that makes education accessible, shared and usable again by leveraging students’ knowledge, by encouraging students to share what they learn and learn from what other students shared, and by involving students in the creation of (personalized) course curriculums.
