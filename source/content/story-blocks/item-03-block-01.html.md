We have explored a few paths that we could take with Offcourse. 

## Structure

Our first approach was focussed on providing structure to learning.

However user research suggested that it did it was a bit too structured

## Social

We then let another party take a crack at it. They focussed on the social part of learning.

## Current

Our current iteration focused on getting the tech ready.
