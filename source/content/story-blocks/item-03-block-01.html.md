We like prototypes! They are a cheap way to learn and keep learning. Here they are: 

### Paper proto:

When sitting down with students we noticed that the way we phrased our content was amoungst one of the hardest things. Here we learned that in order to get structure, we need to impose limits. After all, if you want a final unit of content, we are not your goto. Building a site of your own is probably a better idea, we love to link and structure it for you! 

### Student iteration:

When teaching Coding the Humanities, it became clear that we wanted the platform to be done yesterday. So we assigned a group of students to build their own prototype, to help them with teaching classes. Here we stuggeled with the size of the unit, the university provided us with a course unit, but this was way too large for the platform.

### First iteration

The first actual materialization of our thought, and boy, we disliked it quite a bit. Some of us even thought that this effort would never amount to anything. From there on out we let loose quite a bit of control and simplified the tool quite a bit. 

### Lifely iteration

We wanted another perspective on matters, so we let someone else take our idea's and build upon it. That proved to be quite fruitfull. They focussed quite a bit on the social and this let us to reason that this is n√≥t what we want to achieve. We're learners who like to teach, not share. Both learning and teaching take a bit more effort than a clicking like button.  

### Second iteration

Sure. We're not done but a longshot. This is the version where you clicked on 'about', to get here. You might say it looks a bit like pinterest of learning right now. It offers an interesting perspective. You should know however, the major part of the work is in the API right now, that is core of our product. We want to keep being able to put multiple interfaces on our tool.
