We have explored a few paths that we could take with Offcourse. 

## Structure

The first approach we took was structuring the content with a waypoint and checkpoints. You can explore it here:

## Social

The second approach was to let another team take a crack at it. They focussed on the social part of learning.

## Current

Our second iteration is focussed on flatting out the structure, while maintaining the core idea's.
