We like prototypes! They are a cheap way to learn and keep learning. Here they are: 

### Paper iteration:

When sitting down with students we noticed that the way we phrased our content was amongst one of the hardest things. Here we learned that in order to get structure, we needed to impose limits. After all, being a final unit for content is not our intent. Building a site of your own is probably a better idea. 

### Student iteration:

When teaching Coding the Humanities, it became clear that we wanted the platform to be done yesterday. So we assigned a group of students to build their own prototype, to help them with teaching classes. Here we struggled with the size of the unit, the university provided us with a course unit, but this was way too large for the platform. We learned to go for smaller more controlled units

### First iteration

The first actual materialization of our thought. It was great to finally have something concrete. We made a first batch of content and let some people interact with it. However we quickly learned that we tried to control a bit too much.

### Lifely iteration

We wanted another perspective on matters, so we let someone else take our idea's and build upon it. That proved to be quite fruitful. They focussed on the social. As we were not the executing the prototype ourselves we could really take a reactive position and find our essence. We're learners who like to teach. Sharing is a part of that, but the quick fixes of a like button, or constant badgering with communication channels, are probably not that constructive.

### Second iteration

Here we let loose quite a bit of control and simplified everything to the essence. From the previous experiments we also learned that in faces should be something that can change and therefore we focussed our development efforts on building a great backend/API/datamodel?. This is the version where you clicked on 'about', to get here. Sure. We're not done but a long shot. You might say it looks a bit like pinterest of learning right now. It again offers an interesting perspective.
