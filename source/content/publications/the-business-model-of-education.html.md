“Innovative business models are transforming industry landscapes at unprecedented scale and speed. Now is the time to address the challenge of business model generation. Business model innovation is about creating value. … It is about replacing outdated models” [Business Model Generation](www.businessmodelgeneration.com). This passage made me think about the business model of education. What’s the business model of education today? And would education look like if it changed? 

When I applied for a three year program of Literary Studies in 2006, I went to university to obtain a degree. Yet, to get that degree, I had to pay for three years of teaching. The diploma that was awarded to me at the end of those years (four years–I took a year to work and study in Ghent) was awarded to me by that same institution that I’d paid to teach me. This felt weird. Was their assessment and assessment of me? Or an assessment of themselves?

What if the business model of schools and universities changed? What if learning were free, and you pay for an assessment instead (if and when you need it)? What if you could choose who will assess you–someone whose authority means most to you and the field that you aspire to work in? Would education be more accessible? Would learning stop being confined to those few years in college, but become entrenched in your daily work? Could education finally become more relevant to the work place? I can’t help but dream. 

It’s one of the big dreams behind an early stage venture that I’m part of, called Offcourse. We are building an open source hub to record, share and track your learning. We want to make learning and professional growth personal and accessible. It’s a little bit like GitHub, but for learners everywhere. [You can find an early glimpse of the prototype UI here.](staging.offcourse.io) 

Do you have any thoughts that may help us move along in our thinking? I’d love to hear them. 

Happy learning, 

Offcourse
