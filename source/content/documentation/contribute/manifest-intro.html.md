Education is becoming more and more expensive. The average college debt has more than tripled over the last two decades. Yet, degrees are less and less attuned to the job market, because creating a great curriculum takes time, while industries, ideas and technologies change every day.

Meanwhile, almost anything you may want to learn is posted online every minute of every day. Both experts and learners of nearly every topic imaginable (from coding to soldering), write blogs posts and create video’s to share their skills with you. The hard part is knowing where to start and what to do next. Yet, by finding the right resources at the right time, we believe that you can master nearly any skill you want.

Yes, there are a lot of online learning solutions out there already. However, a lot of them are still modeled after the traditional classroom, which consists of one teacher and 29 students. At Offcourse, we look at that same classroom and see 30 potential teachers. Can you imagine a world with 17 billion potential teachers? We can! We need you to help us make this a reality.

Offcourse is an online tool that lets you collect links to the best learning resources on the web and share them with others. Unlike other online learning platforms, Offcourse allows you to copy and alter other people’s lists to make them suit your personal learning goals. Offcourse also features smart learning analytics and learning data analysis, providing valuable insight in how you learn and to recommend you what blog post, article or podcast to read or listen to next. Offcourse makes learning simple.

We believe that you can learn anything. 

We believe that you can teach anything. 

We believe that you can do anything. 

Together, we can bring free, personalized and community-driven education to learners around the globe.
