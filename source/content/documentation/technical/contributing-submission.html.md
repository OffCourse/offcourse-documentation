The centrepiece in the submission is the version control tool Git and the host/collaborative environment Github. If you do not know them yet, [learn](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) them and try them out. The general idea is that when you start, you fork the project; and when you're done, you submit a pull request. This gives you a safe space to experiment, while it is very easy to collaborate. The pull request should include an short but complete write-up of what youâ€™ve done. In this write-up you should highlight possible concerns with your implementation and why you chose such. This makes it very clear to the rest of the team what has been made and what to look for when scanning the code. It is quite possible that you'll get some critique at this point, but they will most often point you in the right direction. If there is no critique, it will be accepted after a few days, and you are done!
