The centerpiece in the contribution workflow is the version control tool Git and the host/collaborative environment Github. If you do not know them yet, [learn](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) them and try them out. The general idea is that you fork the project you will be working on and submit a pull request to the main repository when you are done. This gives you a safe space to experiment, while it is very easy to collaborate. The pull request should include an short but complete writeup of what youâ€™ve done. In this writeup you should highlight possible concerns with the implementation and why you chose such. This makes it very clear to the rest of the team what has been made and what to look for when scanning the code. If no critique is being voiced by the maintainers, it will be accepted, if not they will direct you to what to fix.
