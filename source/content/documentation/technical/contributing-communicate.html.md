The roadmap and issues are nice to communicate with the entire team and community, but sometimes you really want closer contact. For that reason we assigned a mentor to every item. This is usually a person on the core team whom is well versed with the code and processes. If you want to take up an issue, this is the person you approach. Often this is also the person whom will accept your pull request when the time is there, so if your mentor approves of the code youâ€™ve written, its very likely enter the code-base. You can approach a mentor through many ways, but we prefer the slack/gitter(?) channel. Keep in touch while building, not only for yourself, but its also important to us!
