Contributions to Offcourse are coordinated through the roadmap. All features currently discussed are there. These range from nearly utopian features that might never be build, to core features in active development. An issue can be in one of four different stages: active development, staging, sidetracked and still conceptual. Depending on your preference and skill you can contribute at all stages. 

If you’re a beginner it might be interesting to either take a small staged or sidetracked feature so that you can take all the time you need to develop it. If you’re more comfortable a coder you can also take a conceptual idea and break it down in its constituent steps, the features themselves need to be written too. If you are not a coder it is even possible to contribute, especially at the conceptual stage. Before a feature moves from conceptual to being staged, waiting to be picked up by a developer, many things need to be determined. UI/UX, viability and importance, user research, etcetera.
