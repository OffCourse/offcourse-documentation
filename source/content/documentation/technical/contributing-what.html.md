Contributions to Offcourse are coordinated through the [roadmap](http://user-staging.offcourse.io/documentation/roadmap.html). All features currently discussed are there. These range from nearly utopian features that might never be build, to core features in active development. An issue can be in one of four different stages: active development, staging, sidetracked and still conceptual. Your preference and skill will determine the stage in which you contribute, all stages are open and we have an archive. There are also several topics, most often these will either be api, platform or content. 

If you are a beginner it might be interesting to either take a small staged or sidetracked feature so that you can take all the time you need to develop it. These are already broken down into their constituent steps. If you are more comfortable you can also take a conceptual idea and break it down, the roadmap texts themselves need to be written too. If you are not a coder it is even possible to contribute, especially at the conceptual stage. Before a feature moves from conceptual to being staged, waiting to be picked up by a developer, many things need to be determined. UI/UX design, user research, viability and importance, etcetera.
