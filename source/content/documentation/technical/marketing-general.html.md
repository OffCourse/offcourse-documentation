The informational site currently has three major features: Firstly it is the current portal for Offcourse. The portal page provides an insight in our aims, CTA's and presents the platform and the team. While its now the entry for [Offcourse.io](http://www.offcourse.io), its goal will eventually be to provide a more in-depth contextualization to the platform. Secondly the informational site functions as an extensive documentation for the project. There are style guides, assets, technical clarifications and the explanation to what we stand for. Thirdly it serves a communicative function with the roadmap. This makes it easier to direct the team and other contributors. It is meant to get people involved, for instance to code a feature, or simply to voice feedback. This slow and permanent form of communication is also much better at archiving than our Slack channels, to-do-lists, or even meeting notes.
