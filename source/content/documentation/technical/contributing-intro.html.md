Letâ€™s get one thing clear right of the bat: We love for anyone to contribute to Offcourse and we will reward you in any way that is possible. We are open source and will always remain so, we really depend on you to help us advance this learning effort. If you want to know more about that read our [manifest](http://user-staging.offcourse.io/documentation/manifest.html) and [reward structure](http://user-staging.offcourse.io/documentation/rewards.html). The focus of this document is on **how** to contribute.
