Once you have gained enough contribution points, you are ready for level 2. In level 2, we have defined three roles: mentors, ambassadors and certified developers. As  part of level 2, you will receive Offcourse promotion material and your name will be written on the community page of our website. You cannot start directly as a mentor, an ambassador or a certified expert. We do this to make sure that you share the ideas of Offcourse and represent our values.

### Mentor

If you have reached level 2, you can choose to become a mentor. Mentors help others to receive their goals. This means that you will be open for coaching when contributors at level 1 are stuck or need help. Learners can then work 1:1 with you as an expert mentor for debugging help, code review and pair programming via screen sharing, video or text chat. A mentor guides others through the process, sets guidelines, and helps them solve problems. It is entirely up to you for how long, which days or at what time you will be available. Just set up a meeting with a level 1 learner and help other programmers become as awesome as you!

### Ambassador

As an ambassador, you can choose to contribute to the representation of Offcourse through several ways such as writing blog posts or helping out with our social media. For example, if you write a blog post about Offcourse, you will receive points for this. Typically, ambassadors are expert developers or people that have a leading role within their organization or working field. However, this is not a necessity, anybody can be an ambassador by contributing to the platform and earning sufficient points.

### Certified expert

If you don’t want to become a mentor or an ambassador, but still want to keep contributing to the development of Offcourse, then you can choose the path of a certified expert. This means that you will keep contributing to Offcourse’s repository on GitHub and expand your portfolio of cool features on Offcourse’s platform. As a certified expert, you are also able to accept or deny other contributors’ push requests, as you are one step higher in the hierarchy.
