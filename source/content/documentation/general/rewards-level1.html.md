In the first level, there is only one role. That is the role of the learner/contributor. Everybody that wants to be part of Offcourse starts at level 1; regardless of your experience, age or skills.

### Contributor

Contributors contribute to the code of the Offcourse repository on Github. This allows the contributor to put its learned skills into practice and directly make a positive impact on the further development of the platform.

#### For new developers

At Offcourse, it doesn’t matter whether you are just starting your programming journey or are already an experienced programmer. If you’re new to the programming field, you will soon find out that studying is not enough, you will in fact need specific experience to level up your coding skills. Offcourse provides you these handles and helps you with everything you need to become a better programmer.

#### For experienced developers

At Offcourse, you can always learn new things. Or perhaps you want to develop an awesome new feature and receive full credit for it, so that you can showcase it to the world.

Every time you make a contribution, you gain points. These points help you to reach new levels, each with its own perks. Learners can receive help from mentors, which is the next role within our organization. As a learner, mentors are there to help you reach your goals. We are constantly looking for innovation and as we are a crowd-driven platform, the majority of the people (with voting rights) will decide for new platform features to be build. Points can also be collected by making a donation, with the value of the donation being the same as the points awarded, to a maximum of 100 points.
