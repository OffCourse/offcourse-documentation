Level 3 is the highest level within our organization. This level consists of one role final role: ownership. The owners at Offcourse are only a select group of people.

### Owner

Once you have enough experience as either a mentor, an ambassador or a certified expert (or a combination of those roles), you will have the possibility to become an owner. Becoming an owner is our way to appreciate your value to Offcourse. When you choose to become an owner, you become part of the team. Owners get access to our general slack channel and an invite to our weekly Skype call. Furthermore, they have the possibility to vote for technical and strategic decisions on the platform. Owners are thus actively contributing to the development of Offcourse and in exchange they receive a minority share. We have pooled an X amount of shares of the organization in a foundation and will distribute those shares among the owners.
