## Level 1

In the first level, there is only one role. That is the role of the learner/contributor. Everybody that wants to be part of Offcourse starts at level 1; regardless of your experience, age or skills.

### Contributor

Contributors contribute to the code of the Offcourse repository on Github. This allows the contributor to put its learned skills into practice and directly make a positive impact on the further development of the platform.

#### For new developers

At Offcourse, it doesn’t matter whether you are just starting your programming journey or are already an experienced programmer. If you’re new to the programming field, you will soon find out that studying is not enough, you will in fact need specific experience to level up your coding skills. Offcourse provides you these handles and helps you with everything you need to become a better programmer.

#### For experienced developers

At Offcourse, you can always learn new things. Or perhaps you want to develop an awesome new feature and receive full credit for it, so that you can showcase it to the world.

Every time you make a contribution, you gain points. These points help you to reach new levels, each with its own perks. Learners can receive help from mentors, which is the next role within our organization. As a learner, mentors are there to help you reach your goals. We are constantly looking for innovation and as we are a crowd-driven platform, the majority of the people (with voting rights) will decide for new platform features to be build. Points can also be collected by making a donation, with the value of the donation being the same as the points awarded, to a maximum of 100 points.
 
## Level 2

Once you have gained enough contribution points, you are ready for level 2. In level 2, we have defined three roles: mentors, ambassadors and certified developers. As  part of level 2, you will receive Offcourse promotion material and your name will be written on the community page of our website. You cannot start directly as a mentor, an ambassador or a certified expert. We do this to make sure that you share the ideas of Offcourse and represent our values.

### Mentor

If you have reached level 2, you can choose to become a mentor. Mentors help others to receive their goals. This means that you will be open for coaching when contributors at level 1 are stuck or need help. Learners can then work 1:1 with you as an expert mentor for debugging help, code review and pair programming via screen sharing, video or text chat. A mentor guides others through the process, sets guidelines, and helps them solve problems. It is entirely up to you for how long, which days or at what time you will be available. Just set up a meeting with a level 1 learner and help other programmers become as awesome as you!

### Ambassador

As an ambassador, you can choose to contribute to the representation of Offcourse through several ways such as writing blog posts or helping out with our social media. For example, if you write a blog post about Offcourse, you will receive points for this. Typically, ambassadors are expert developers or people that have a leading role within their organization or working field. However, this is not a necessity, anybody can be an ambassador by contributing to the platform and earning sufficient points.

### Certified expert

If you don’t want to become a mentor or an ambassador, but still want to keep contributing to the development of Offcourse, then you can choose the path of a certified expert. This means that you will keep contributing to Offcourse’s repository on GitHub and expand your portfolio of cool features on Offcourse’s platform. As a certified expert, you are also able to accept or deny other contributors’ push requests, as you are one step higher in the hierarchy.

## Level 3

Level 3 is the highest level within our organization. This level consists of one role final role: ownership. The owners at Offcourse are only a select group of people.

### Owner

Once you have enough experience as either a mentor, an ambassador or a certified expert (or a combination of those roles), you will have the possibility to become an owner. Becoming an owner is our way to appreciate your value to Offcourse. When you choose to become an owner, you become part of the team. Owners get access to our general slack channel and an invite to our weekly Skype call. Furthermore, they have the possibility to vote for technical and strategic decisions on the platform. Owners are thus actively contributing to the development of Offcourse and in exchange they receive a minority share. We have pooled an X amount of shares of the organization in a foundation and will distribute those shares among the owners.
