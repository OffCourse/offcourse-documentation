## When you find the right resources at the right time, you can master any skill you want.

Almost anything people may want to learn is posted online every minute of every day. Both experts and learners of nearly every topic imaginable (from coding to shoemaking), write blogs posts and create videos to share their skills with the world. The hard part is knowing where to start and what to do next. Yet, by finding the right resources at the right time, we believe that everybody can master nearly any skill they want.

Offcourse is an online tool that helps people to collect links to the best learning resources on the web and share them with others. Offcourse makes learning as simple as possible.
