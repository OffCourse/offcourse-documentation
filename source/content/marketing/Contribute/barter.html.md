Offcourse is looking for professionals – yes, you are a professional too! Most people who want to learn a (new) programming language already possess evenly valuable skills in a different field. But as a software apprentice, your other expertise is often disregarded.

Here’s where our barter bootcamp comes in. We offer two 8-week remote coding courses free of charge in exchange for your skill. During the Barter Bootcamp you:

- Learn coding through a specially curated curriculum
- Receive professional coaching [from our developers](http://offcourse.io/contribute) as well as others in our community
- Boost your CV with a personal recommendation from Offcourse
- Connect with peers in a dedicated Slack channel
- Are involved in a real-world project
