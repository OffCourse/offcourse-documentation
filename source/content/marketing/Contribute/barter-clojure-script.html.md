# ClojureScript

*Remote, 8 weeks, 24 hours per week, next batch starting Nov. 1, working knowledge of JavaScript required*

Learn core functional programming fundamentals and contribute to your first open source project. Through an 8-week program, you will learn about Clojure and ClojureScript. In return, you will commit to an open source contribution to the Offcourse platform. Unlike many other open source projects, we will guide you through making your contributions by offering coaching and feedback on pull requests. An intake is part of the application procedure.
