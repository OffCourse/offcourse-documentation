The educational system is broken. Degrees become more and more expensive, while curriculums are less and less attuned to the job market. Many online solutions exist, but most of them are still modelled after the traditional classroom.

We believe that true innovation happens when two disciplines interact with one another and create something that wasn’t possible before. That’s why we’re building Offcourse. 

Offcourse will allow you to collect, share and track the best content in one place. Offcourse is free, open source, and design to recommend learning tracks specifically for you. We are creating a future of education that’s free, open source and personal. Join us.
