## Learn ClojureScript and contribute to your first open source project in 8 weeks. 

Do you know JavaScript and would you like to learn functional programming? And are you looking to contribute to your first open source project? We offer an 8-week program that will teach you ClojureScript and help you write your first ClojureScript code. 

Unlike many other open source projects, we offer you a space for learning and guide you through your contributions with personal feedback. During week 0 - 4 you follow a ClojureScript crash course (20 hours of self study + 2 hours of group mentoring). From week 5 - 8, you code and deploy your contribution. 

- Learn ClojureScript in through a series of hand picked resources
- Receive 2 hours of free group mentoring per week at a value of $1280 in return for your open source contribution
- Get personal feedback on your pull requests
