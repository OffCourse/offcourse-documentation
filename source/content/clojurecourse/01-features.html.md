    Somehow, we keep creating new content. But there’s so much information out there already! So gather those great blog posts, podcasts and tutorials and turn them into collections on topics you love.

    Share your collections and get in touch with people from all over the world. You can copy and edit their collections, and make them just right for you. Imagine the different perspectives, and what you’ll learn from them.

    Only, and only if, you want, you can enable Offcourse_ to track your progress. This way, you will build a personal profile that you can show to (future) employers to show off your mad skills on any topic.
